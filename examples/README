Examples for HTML::FromMail
===========================

This directory contains two examples for the "oodoc" or "magic" formatter.
The latter requires Bundle::Text::MagicTemplate to be installed.

 show_all.pl [-v] msg   # where "msg" is a file containing one message
                        #    without a leading 'From '
   will run the template in templ_all.  It will show you many (not all)
   features provided by the template system.
   You have to modify show_all.pl, to select the browser you use.

 demo.pl [-v] folder
   will run the templates in templ_demo.  It will display the first
   message in the folder in a complex way.  In coming releases, the
   whole folder will be displayed, however the module doesn't support
   the required features yet.
   You have to modify demo.pl, to select the browser you use.
