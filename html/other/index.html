    <p>The C<HTML::FromMail> module is designed to produce web-based
    mail clients.  It is currently in the initial state, which means
    that there still is a lot of work to do before the target is
    reached. On the other hand, displaying single messages in a nice way
    is already possible, and the framework to produce better results is
    on its place.</p>
    
    <p><a href="example/">EXAMPLE</a> with a simple message. The output
    is produce by the <code>examples/demo.pl</code> script, which is
    part of the distribution. The output is extremely configurable with a
    simple template system.</p>

    <dd>Many manual pages contain a DETAILS chapter which explains all

        specifics, and examples of complex use of the items.  Looking
        through the full list of details may help to find a solution.

    <h2>Warning</h2>

    <p>The module is still quite young and therefore due for rapid
    change.  The common structure will stand, but the capabilities
    will grow fast.  This may mean that you want to adapt to each
    next release of the module, which will cost you some time for
    each release.  I will do my best to be backwards compatible.</p>
